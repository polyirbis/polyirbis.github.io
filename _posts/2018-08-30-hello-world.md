<p>All journeys have to start somewhere. Going out of your home, into the unknown, you face many challenges, dangers, but mostly... you find new <strong>opportunities</strong> </p>
<p>And so, this project begins as a clean slate. A blank notebook whose pages will slowly be filled with knowledge, new experiences, moments of satisfaction, but also moments of despair</p>
<p>I feel very excited because I think that this is something truly great, something that will invariably make a difference in my life. The feeling that it can become anything but that it only depends on me, on what I do with it</p>
<p>This certainly won't be a terribly long entry, but I want to say that I am really excited to what this will bring. So, hold onto your seat and get ready for some action!</p>
