<strong>Hello there!</strong> My name is Luis Fernando Johannsen, also known as Shaun Winter.
I'm a Game Development BA student at <a href="http://mexico.sae.edu/">SAE Institute Mexico City.</a>
I'm about to finish my final year, and this is the final project that will (hopefully) give me freedom to go into the world!
Among my passions there's photography, music production, 3D texturing and modeling, programming, learning new stuff and drawing!
I invite you to have a look around and see for yourself what this blog has to offer. And, if you feel like it, drop me a line at Twitter. Links are on the sidebar!
